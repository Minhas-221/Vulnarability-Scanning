## 🧐 Problem Statement: <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
With the very rapid development of the Internet, web applications are becoming more and more popular among us. The client applications have gradually been replaced by web applications in industries, but its security level is still very low, so web applications have become the main target of attackers. In order to ensure the security of the information system in industries, it is particularly important to find out web application security vulnerabilities fastly and accurately. The automated vulnerability scanning system that we are providing will improve the efficiency of web application vulnerability scanning compared to traditional manual detection vulnerabilities that are time-consuming, inefficient, and labor-intensive. Based on the above problems, this idea has been put forward and a positive outcome is expected out of it which will not just benefit small industries but also the big industries which invest a lot of manpower and revenue to keep their systems safe. 

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
